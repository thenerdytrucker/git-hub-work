    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm William Richards, a passionate data science enthusiast with experience in analyzing data, building models, and delivering insights. I'm a disciplined professional transitioning from logistics, where I balanced 11-hour CDL driving shifts with 20‚Äì30 hours per week of hands-on Python and data science training. As a father of four, stepfather to five, and happily married for five years, I've honed exceptional time management, leadership, and multitasking skills. I thrive on solving complex problems, collaborating across teams, and turning raw data into clear, actionable strategies that drive real-world results.
